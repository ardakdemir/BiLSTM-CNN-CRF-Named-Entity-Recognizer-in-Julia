# BiLSTM-CNN-CRF-Named-Entity-Recognizer-in-Julia

Developed by Arda Akdemir, as part of the EU-funded Emerging Welfare Work Package 2 (Information Extraction) in Koc University.
We made use of the kNet package to develop our model which is a deep learning package also developed in Koc University.
The model is the reimplementation of the state-of-the-art named entity recognition model (End-to-end Sequence Labeling via Bi-directional LSTM-CNNs-CRF)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01354.pdf].
